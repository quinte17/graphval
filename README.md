graphval
========
This project aims to get an educational tool for graph evaluation.
The inputfiles are based on a simpler dot syntax. You can describe
a deterministic finite automaton and interpret this dfa with
graphval. And you can draw a markov-chain and generate the matrix-output
for different languages.
